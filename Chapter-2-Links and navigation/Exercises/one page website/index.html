        <p>Oppenheimer is a biopic and it tells the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist, and his contributions towards the creation of an atomic bomb during the World War II. The main storyline focuses on Oppenheimer from the beginning of his educational career to the launching of the Manhattan Project (the first nuclear weapons development program) and the many consequences, both social and political, that he faced afterward.The film covers the moral struggles he faced due to the devastation that the weapon caused, alongside all of the character assassination he faced during the 1954 loyalty hearings that stripped him of his security clearances, to reflect the extent of scrutiny that he faced.</p>
